## Spring

Spring is a framework that simplifies the development of Java applications. It is an open-source project that is distributed under the umbrella of the Spring Framework.

### IoC (Inversion of Control)

IoC is a design principle in software engineering that allows the control of objects or portions of a program to be transferred to a container or framework. In the context of Spring, IoC is primarily achieved through the Spring container, which is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and managing objects (beans).


### Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design principle in software engineering that allows the separation of concerns between objects and their dependencies. In the context of Spring, DI is primarily achieved through the Spring container, which is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and managing objects (beans).
